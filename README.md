A Website for Nam
====

### Nam Wayne

Nam is a longtime friend. He's a hyper-talented artist, who has worked successfully on so many mediums, from documentaries, to mural paintings to making music.

This site focuses on his current music and promotional outreach materials. I told him I'd bake him a site that would be free, late, and low-quality. I'm actually going to make him a nice site, but just in case, it's important to manage everyone's expectations and keep friendships intact.

### Project Goals

- Have a landing/splash page for him to direct social media, share content, and more to supporters
- Integrate with Nam's Soundcloud/Bandcamp accounts; play tracks in-browser
- Allow people to securely purchase music, if they'd like to support him
- A forum/posting board with an admin approval process in case comments get rude.
- Schedule of upcoming performances
- Bio, band members bios (and links to other band members websites if they have them)
